# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Analysis: Kernel Impact on Classification Performance

This repository contains a tutorial and practical implementation of **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** using the Iris dataset. The project explores how different kernel functions influence the classification performance, providing insights into kernel selection, hyperparameter tuning, and decision boundary visualization.

## Project Overview

SVMs are powerful supervised machine learning algorithms known for their ability to classify linear and non-linear data. This project focuses on:

1. Exploring the theoretical foundations of SVMs.
2. Analyzing the impact of kernel functions (Linear, Polynomial, RBF) on SVM performance.
3. Implementing SVMs using Python and scikit-learn with the Iris dataset.
4. Visualizing decision boundaries for various kernel configurations.
5. Optimizing SVMs through hyperparameter tuning.
